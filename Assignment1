Q2. Difference between display,visibility,opacity,z-index in CSS?

Ans.
        display is a CSS property that specifies the type of layout box an HTML element should use. Some common values include block, which creates a block-level element that takes up the full width of its parent container and creates a new line after it, and inline, which creates an inline element that only takes up as much width as necessary and does not create a new line.

   visibility is a CSS property that specifies whether an element should be visible or not. If an element has a visibility of hidden, it will be invisible but still take up space in the layout. If an element has a visibility of collapse, it will be removed from the layout entirely.
   opacity is a CSS property that specifies the transparency of an element. An element with an opacity of 1 is completely opaque, while an element with an opacity of 0 is completely transparent.
   z-index is a CSS property that specifies the stack order of an element. An element with a higher z-index will appear in front of an element with a lower z-index.
 Note:  z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative,        position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements).
Note:  If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in the HTML code will be shown on top.Â
